# ðŸ§  Typing Speed Test in Python
This project is a simple command-line based Typing Speed Test developed in Python. It evaluates how fast and accurately a user can type a given sentence.


## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Random sentence selection for each test

- Calculates typing speed in words per second

- Counts the number of typing mistakes

- Continuously runs until the user decides to exit


## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. The user is prompted to start the test.

2. A random sentence is displayed.

3. The user types the sentence and presses Enter.

4. The program calculates:
   - Speed: Characters typed per second.

   - Errors: Number of character mismatches.

5. The user can continue or exit the test.


## ðŸ›  Requirements

- Python 3.x (No external libraries required)


## ðŸ“„ Usage
Run the script in a terminal:

``` 
python typing_speed_test.py
```

Example interaction:

```
Ready to test : yes/no : yes
***** Typing Speed *****

Enter : my name is tejas talole
Speed :  3  w/sec
Error :  0
```
